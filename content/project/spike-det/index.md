A problem relevant to large genetic datasets is the detection of population stratification. It is believed that the
presence of such stratification manifests in the spectrum of the large genetic matrices as increased eigenvalues,
known as “spikes”. We investigate the statistical testing of the presence of these spikes, establishing conditions
under which such detection is possible. Additionally, we investigate the behaviour of different tests and make
comparisons of the power of these tests in asymptotic regimes.
