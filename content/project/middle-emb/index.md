Surgical evacuation is the standard treatment for chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) but is associated with
a high risk of recurrence and readmission. Middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) is a novel treatment
approach which could be performed upfront or in adjunction to surgical evacuation. MMAE studies are limited
by small sample sizes. This study aimed to describe and compare outcomes of MMAE in adjunction to surgery
with those of surgery alone on a national level.
