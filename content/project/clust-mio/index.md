We create a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approach for doing cluster-aware regression, i.e. linear re-
gression that takes into account the inherent clustered structure of the data. We compare to the linear mixed
effects regression (LMEM) which is the benchmark method, and design simulation experiments to show
superior performance to LMEM in terms of both predictive and inferential metrics in silico. Furthermore, we
show our method allows for generalization to new data points, using an interpretable classification tree. We
demonstrate the power of this generalizability on a real protein expression dataset.
