Older adults receive benzodiazepines for agitation, anxiety, and insomnia after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). No
trials have been conducted to determine if benzodiazepine use affects poststroke mortality in the elderly. Recent
work has concluded that there is no short-term mortality from benzodiazepine use post-acute ischemic stroke
in a local cohort of patients. We look to extend the analysis of mortality and other important outcomes to the
Medicare dataset, linked with insurance registry claims. We employ methodology from emulated trials liter-
ature to construct sophisticated models that account for semi-competing risks and overlapping observation times.
