Genetics is being increasingly used to study disease biology, for prediction, and for the elucidation of causal relationships between risk factors to health and disease outcomes. A particular problem of interest is the study of the association of genetic determinants of proteins with glycemic traits. These associations would allow us to potentially identify proteins that mediate genetic effects on diabetes, evaluate the potential to predict glycemic traits using genetic determinants of these proteins, and quantify the proportion of the heritability of these traits attributable to the proteins.  Our primary goal is to improve the estimation of these associations using the estimated genetic correlation between proteins and traits. The incorporation of genetic correlations in our analysis posits a "constrained" association, which requires tailored methodology, particularly in the high dimensional case. We work on the construction and show the optimality of estimators and algorithms for a range of dimensional cases. Finally, we can use these estimated effects on glycemic traits to study polygenic risk scores (PRS) for these traits and assess the proportion of variance that it explains.
