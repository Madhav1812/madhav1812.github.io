Genetics is being increasingly used to study disease biology, for prediction, and a particular problem of interest
is the study of the association of genetic determinants of proteins with glycemic traits. These associations would
allow us to potentially identify proteins that mediate genetic effects on diabetes, evaluate the potential to predict
glycemic traits using genetic determinants of these proteins, and quantify the proportion of the heritability of
these traits attributable to the proteins. Our primary goal is to improve the estimation of these associations
using the estimated genetic correlation between proteins and traits, which posits a "constrained" association
problem. This requires tailored methodology, particularly in the high dimensional case.
